My name is Anna HÃ¸yem Lademo. I am an international student from Norway, visiting UBC this year (24/25). My field of study is Biotechnology, with a specialization towards molecular biology and medicine. I have also taken some courses in programming, systems biology etc. which is why I have chosen this course. My hope is to learn more about programming and analysis of biological data, and be able to use this in my further research where single cell analysis among other methods will be relevant. 
This repository contains an intro assignment in Statistical Methods of High Dimensional Biology. It is meant as a practice assignment for learning basics about R and Git.
